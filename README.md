## Introduction - Project Purpose

For project two i chose the travel website project where i was tasked with creating a project that utilised Google maps i settled on a site
that would allow users to find locations throughout towns and citys in South Africa while also being able to view images taken from major holliday locations
in the country.
## UX
 
### Goals

To allow the user to find locations for their holliday in South Africa.

#### Target Audience

- Users whom speak English as currently this is the only language catered for.
- Holidaymakers of all ages looking for potential holiday destinations.
- Holidaymakers whom have already have a holiday booked to South Africa.
- Students between 18 & 28 looking for somewhere to go on a gap year.

#### Customer Goals

- Have a fully proficient & intuitive website.
- Reach a variety of new customers.
- help people find locations to visit in near where they are staying

### User Stories

#### As a Travel Company I want to...

- Have an attractive & fast website which will keep users engaged.
- Provide a pleasant user experience so users continue to visit the site.
- Enable users to easily find a variety of accomodation/attractions within their desired location.
- Help to increase turnover at attractions so they'll actively advertise Happy Hollidays, e.g. via their own website.
- At some point in the future drive further revenue via sponsorship & advertising from searched locations & accomodation/attractions.
- Allow site visitors to contact me should they have any enquiries.


#### As a UX Designer I want to...

- Track user behaviour to continue to enhance the user experience.
- Provide a website which is attractive, yet can easily be modified as per the travel companies request.
- Ensure the functionality of the website provides the results required by the user.
- Provide a means for the user to contact the travel company.

#### As a User I want to...

- Find a variety of accomodation/attractions within a desired location on one website.
- see whats in the city i am staying 
- Find accomodation/attractions which I would ordinarily only have found through exstensive Google searches.

#### As a Customer(owner of accomodation/attraction) I want to...

- Increase the number of visitors to my accomodation/attraction.
- Increase tourist numbers to drive revenue in the area I want to promote.
- Have another means for potential visitors to find my accomodation/attraction other than via exstensive search engines.
- Allow me to promote my accomodation/attraction without having to attempt to move myself higher up search engine results.

### Design

#### Colours

- Orange
- light Blue
- Grey

using the image of South Africa as a base i chose colours that complemented the picture.

#### Fonts

- Fjalla One
- Josefin Sans

Both fonts were found on the site [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They were chosen due to the simple & clean look they have,
which compliments the colour scheme. 

### Wireframes

- All Wireframes were created using Balsamiq 3 software.

- [wireframes](https://github.com/OriHillairetdev/Milestone-project-2/blob/74f91d9bbec843b3e65cdec8ed50e63c59e975ed/assets/images/wireframes).
